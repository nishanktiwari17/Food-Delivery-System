# Food-Delivery-System

This project is developed as a part of coursework for Syracuse University's CSE687 Object-Oriented Design course.

# Project Overview

There is a noticeable void in providing for the food needs of students, staff, and faculty in the midst of the busy activity at Syracuse University's Schine Student Centre, the centre of campus life. Even though the area is filled with a variety of cafes and restaurants, the lack of an online delivery system causes a great deal of inconvenience for customers as they have to physically visit these establishments, which frequently results in long wait times and interferes with busy schedules. To bridge this gap and improve the dining experience for the Schine community, we propose developing a comprehensive food delivery system. Our solution, which uses current technology and object-oriented design concepts, intends to expedite the ordering and delivery of meals from the Schine Student Center's different caf√©s and restaurants. Individuals will be able to browse menus, place orders, and get delivery straight to their selected location on campus thanks to a user-friendly platform that is available via the web and mobile devices.
